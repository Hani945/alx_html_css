# 🎧 Headphones Webpage Project

This project is part of the ALX Front-End Curriculum. The goal is to build a complete responsive webpage **from scratch** using only **HTML** and **CSS**. No external CSS libraries or frameworks were used.

## 📐 Design

The webpage was designed by Nicolas Philippot and provided in [Figma](https://www.figma.com) format. The design includes:
- A responsive layout
- Header section (hero)
- “What we do…” section
- “Our results” section
- Contact form
- Footer

All fonts, icons, and assets were included via `.zip` files provided with the project.

## 🧱 Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3 (including media queries for responsiveness)
- Figma (for UI reference)

## 📱 Responsive Design

The webpage is responsive and works on screens as small as 480px wide. On small screens:
- Content stacks vertically
- The navigation becomes a hamburger menu (on JavaScript version)

## 🔗 Interactions

- All links change color on hover/active: `#FF6565`
- Buttons become slightly transparent when hovered (opacity: 0.9)
- Animations are used to enhance icons and stats

## 📁 File Structure

Each task builds on the previous one:

├── 8-index.html
├── 8-styles.css
