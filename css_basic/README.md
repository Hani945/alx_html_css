# CSS Basic Website

This project is part of my learning journey in front-end development. It’s a simple, clean web page structured using HTML5 and styled with CSS. It demonstrates how to build a responsive layout using **Flexbox** and apply custom styling rules for a better user experience.

## 🌐 Pages

- `index.html`: The main portfolio page that includes headings, paragraphs, an image, and a sample table.
- `tweets.html`: A secondary page linked from the header that contains sample tweet content.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts layout for mobile using `<meta name="viewport">` and a custom `.works_on_smartphone` class.
- **Flexbox Layout**:
  - `<body>` uses `flex-direction: column`.
  - `<main>` uses `flex-direction: row` to place `<article>` and `<aside>` side by side.
- **Semantic HTML**: Tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<aside>` used for meaningful structure.
- **Custom Styling**:
  - Colors, borders, spacing, and typography added via `styles.css`.
  - A Unicode character is styled as a **logo** in the header.
