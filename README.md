# 😁 SmileSchool - HTML & CSS Project

Welcome to **SmileSchool**, a beautifully structured front-end web project built using only **HTML5** and **CSS3**, based on a designer's Figma file.

This project demonstrates semantic HTML layout, organized CSS styling, and responsive design principles. It is part of an educational exercise to replicate a pixel-perfect design using no frameworks—just clean, custom code.
